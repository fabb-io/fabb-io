### Hey y'all, I'm Fabio! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a undergraduate Computer Science at the UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Salerno. I was lucky to be able to stady aboard in Spain for 5 months, in the University of San Jorge at the department of Design and Development of Videogames. Already oriented towords this world, I finally had the opportunity to study something related; there I attended four courses, each one in English:

Animation and Simulation; Unity 3D Character Design and Animation; Photoshop, Blender, Substance 3D Designer Development for Mobile Devices; Unity 2D Networks and Multiplayer Systems; Unity 3D

For each one was needed a team project, I worked for 3 months with a friend at each of these ones, feel free to take a look. This was the first time approaching this types of projects for me and for my friend, and in just 3 months we were able to get everything done and with perfects scores; the projects may result "poor" or not completed, but for what we were able to do as first timer we are really satisfied, I also decided to put them here without touching them since the delivery.
